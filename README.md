# photo_marker

##Introduction
Photo Marker is a small AutoHotkey script that was written back in 2009 (?) to help a [local photography club](http://trilliumphotoclub.org/) with the scoring of photos at their judging nights. Since then, I've done the odd bug-fix releases for them.

The functionality was tailored to their specific use case, but there is nothing in the code that would prevent others from using it.

##Usage

Check out the [README.txt](https://github.com/movermeyer/photo_marker/blob/master/README.txt) file or the [User's Manual](https://github.com/movermeyer/photo_marker/blob/master/docs/Photo%20Marker%20User%20Manual.rtf) for instructions on how to use the program

##Compilation
The code is compiled into a Windows binary using the AutoHotkey Official compiler ([Ahk2Exe](https://autohotkey.com/download/))
